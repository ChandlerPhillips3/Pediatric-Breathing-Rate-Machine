# Pediatric-Breathing-Rate-Machine

##Overview
Worked in a team of 6 members to create a Breathing Rate Machine for our client, an occupational therapist, in order calm the breathing rate of her younger patients.


Our Breathing Rate machine we decided to develop was going to be made out of acrylic, laser cut into a shape of a hand on top of a box, powerded by an arduino/ 9V battery. In order to calm the breathing rate of the user, we used LED lights to trace the outline of the hand for the patient, as well as a vibration motor, which would be both signal when the patient should breath in/ out to get their breathing rate in control. The occupational therapist would have freedom to choose different combinations of the two options with different knobs installed on the box.

Chandler Phillips Main Role: **Arduino Code** For the LED Lights and Vibrations of the Breathing Rate Machine

**Please Note:**
The project development time-line is a little funky, as the planning took place in early 2020 and the development had to be shifted to an online environment thanks to the COVID 19 Pandemic in March of 2020.
