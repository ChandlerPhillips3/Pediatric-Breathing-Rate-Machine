# Pediatric-Breathing-Rate-Machine

## Overview
Worked in a team of 6 members to create a Breathing Rate Machine for our client, an occupational therapist, in order calm the breathing rate of her younger patients.


Our Breathing Rate machine we develop was going to be made out of acrylic, laser cut into a shape of a hand on top of a box, powerded by a 9V battrery and arduino. In order to calm the breathing rate of the user, we used LED lights to trace the outline of the hand for the patient, as well as a vibration motor, which would be both signal when the patient should breath in/ out to get their breathing rate in control. The occupational therapist would have freedom to choose different combinations of the two options with different knobs installed on the box.

## Chandler Phillips Main Role
**Arduino Coding** For the LED Lights and Vibrations of the Breathing Rate Machine

**Please Note:**
The projects timeline took place January 2020 - May 2020, which was when the COVID-19 Pandemic outbreak took place. We were forced to shift online and completed an online version of the project, but were never able to produce a physical product. Through the help of online resources (TinkerCAD, CAD, Zoom, etc.), it made an electronic version of the fisable.
